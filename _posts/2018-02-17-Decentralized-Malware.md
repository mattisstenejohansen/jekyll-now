## Introduction to Decentralized Security


## Decentralized Malware
First; lets look at what decentralization means, and how it affects the design of the malware. <br>
A decentralized system is a computer network in which no peer has more power than any other participant. No paper on decentralization can skip an example including Bitcoin, so here we go; 
in order for a Bitcoin transaction to go through, the majority of connected nodes need to validate the transaction. The majority (51%) of the nodes needs to accept the transaction,
 thus the influence of one malicious node is limited to the amount of non-malicious peers.
The decentralized malware should be influenced by the design of a botnet malware, meaning that a multitude of computers (nodes) are affected and performs the same task - in this case manipulate and invalidate transactions. 

## A Conceptual Model

### Semi-Decentralized: Commander-Slave Model
A Commander-Slave model, as seen below, is not fully decentralized, because there is one node in which has more authority than the others, namely the commander.

### Fully Decentralized: self-aware p2p Botnet


#### Proof of Attack


#### Decision-Making
