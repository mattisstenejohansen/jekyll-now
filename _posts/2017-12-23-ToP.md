## Abstract

Transaction Oriented Programming (ToP) is an approach to designing software. It describes that software designers should define formal, precise and verifiable interface specifications for software components, which extend the ordinary definition of abstract data types with preconditions, postconditions and invariants. These specifications are referred to as "transactions", in accordance with a conceptual metaphor with the conditions and obligations of payment transactions.

ToP is a programming paradigm that is aimed at blockchain-relevant programming.
